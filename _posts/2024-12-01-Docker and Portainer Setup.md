In this blog post, Iâ€™ll walk through the process of setting up Docker and Portainer to efficiently manage containerized applications in my Home Lab.

## **Setting Up Docker and Portainer**

To streamline the deployment and management of containerized applications, I leveraged Docker and Portainer. Docker provides a robust platform for containerization, while Portainer offers an intuitive web interface for managing Docker environments.
However, in future projects , I will not always be using Portainer.

### **Installing Docker**

First, I installed Docker on a new kali VM (under VLAN 2424) using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

To verify Docker installation:

```bash
docker --version
```

### **Deploying Portainer**

Portainer simplifies Docker management with an easy-to-use web-based interface. I deployed Portainer using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 \
  --name portainer \
  --restart always \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v portainer_data:/data \
  portainer/portainer-ce
```

After successful deployment, I accessed the Portainer web interface at `http://192.168.60.2:9443`. The setup process included creating an admin account and connecting Portainer to the local Docker environment.
### **Configuring Portainer for VLAN 2424**

After logging into Portainer, I proceeded to configure the network to ensure that containers could operate within VLAN 2424.

#### **Step 1: Creating the Initial Network Configuration**
First, I navigated to the **Networks** tab located in the right-side menu bar and added a new network using the following configuration:

>**Subnet:** I opted for a `/27` subnet range, as I do not anticipate running more than 30 containers simultaneously.
{: .prompt-info }

#### **Step 2: Creating the Network**
Once the initial configuration was set up, I proceeded to create a new network using the previously defined configuration.

Since the network type selected was **Macvlan**, the process required creating the configuration first and then using it to establish the actual network.

By following these steps, I successfully integrated VLAN 2424 into my Portainer setup, allowing my containers to communicate efficiently within the designated VLAN.

## **Benefits of Using Docker and Portainer**

By integrating Docker with Portainer, I gained several advantages:

- **Ease of Management:** A centralized interface to control all running containers.
- **Rapid Deployment:** Quickly deploying, and managing containerized applications.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Real-time insights into CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- **Enhanced Security:** Isolated environments for running vulnerable applications safely.

## **Conclusion**

Setting up Docker and Portainer provided a seamless way to manage containerized environments. This setup allows for efficient deployment, monitoring, and management of applications, making it an essential component for ease of setup of cybersecurity projects.
